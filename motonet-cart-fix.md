# Motonet Add-to-Cart Functionality Fix

## Problem Description
The e-commerce chatbot was experiencing issues with the "add to cart" functionality for the Motonet platform. Users were receiving the following error when attempting to add products to their cart:

```json
{
  "error": "Failed to add item to cart after multiple attempts",
  "details": "motonet addToCart failed: Failed to add product 32-1602 to cart using all available methods",
  "platform": "motonet"
}
```

The error logs showed that all three methods of adding products to the cart were failing:
1. Direct cart API with 'id' parameter
2. Direct cart API with 'productId' parameter
3. Form submission method

## Root Cause Analysis
After examining the code and error logs, we identified two potential issues:

1. **Cookie Authentication Issues**: The cookies used for authentication with the Motonet platform may have expired or become invalid after multiple builds and deployments. The application was not properly refreshing cookies before critical operations.

2. **Product ID Format Handling**: While the product ID "32-1602" was already in the correct format (XX-XXXXX), the Motonet platform might require different formats for different API endpoints or might have changed its API requirements.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Cookie Management
We improved the cookie management system to:
- Track the last refresh time for each platform's cookies
- Check for near-expiration (within 10 minutes) and refresh proactively
- Force refresh cookies before critical operations like adding to cart
- Refresh cookies if they haven't been refreshed in the last 30 minutes
- Provide better logging and status tracking for cookie operations

### 2. Improved Product ID Handling
We enhanced the Motonet adapter to:
- Try multiple variations of the product ID format:
  - Original format with hyphen (e.g., "32-1602")
  - Without hyphen (e.g., "321602")
  - Original unformatted input
- Attempt each variation with all available methods

### 3. Additional API Methods
We added a fourth method using JSON API approach to increase the chances of successful cart operations.

### 4. Increased Timeout Values
We increased the timeout values for API requests from 10 seconds to 15 seconds to accommodate potentially slower responses from the Motonet platform.

## Testing and Verification
The changes have been pushed to the GitHub repository, which will trigger an automatic deployment to Heroku. After deployment, the add-to-cart functionality should be tested with various products, including the previously problematic motor oil product (32-1602).

## Monitoring Recommendations
1. Monitor the application logs for any recurring issues with the add-to-cart functionality
2. Check if cookie refreshing is working properly by examining the logs
3. Consider implementing a more robust cookie management system using headless browser automation for production environments

## Future Improvements
1. Implement a headless browser solution for cookie management to handle complex authentication flows
2. Add more comprehensive error reporting and recovery mechanisms
3. Develop a testing suite specifically for e-commerce platform integrations
4. Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern to handle temporary platform API issues
